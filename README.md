# kalman-filters-from-scratch

A hands-on, code-first exploration of Kalman filters, built from first principles and documented as part of my personal learning journey. This repository is inspired by and follows the structure of **Alex Becker’s excellent reference text**: *Kalman Filter from the Ground Up*.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as:

- 🧠 A **summarization of key concepts and insights** that I find essential for building intuitive understanding of Kalman filters.
- 💻 A **collection of Jupyter notebooks** that emphasize implementation, visualization, and experimentation over formal derivations.
- 🧪 A **sandbox** for building custom Kalman Filter classes, starting from scalar filters and progressing toward full matrix formulations and nonlinear extensions.

## 📚 Attribution

While this repository is **inspired by** and follows the general progression of Alex Becker’s *Kalman Filter from the Ground Up*, it is **not a reproduction** of the reference text in any way. All content here reflects my own learning process, including original code, personal summaries, and selectively chosen derivations. 

All credit for the original structure, explanations, and motivation goes to Alex Becker.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebooks  
- NumPy / Matplotlib  
- FilterPy for benchmarking

---

## 🧭 Motivation

Kalman filtering is foundational in areas like navigation, guidance, and control — especially in aerospace systems.

This project allows me to:
- Internalize concepts by actively **coding and experimenting**
- Understand **what each matrix and equation is doing**, not just how to compute it
- Build and test my own Kalman filter class hierarchy
- Create a reproducible, open-source learning trail for others tackling this topic
